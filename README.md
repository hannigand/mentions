# mentions
A React Native app showcasing @mention functionality.

The project was scaffolded using the React Native CLI (as appose to create-react-native-app).

The solutions proposed are integrated with cross-platform in mind. For example, React Native has an `onKeyPress` function on the `TextInput` Component. Howerver, it is only supported on iOS. Instead, a solution that works across both platforms has been used.

## Technologies
- Redux for state management, redux-logger for logging out actions
- Prettier used for automatic code formatting

## Apps
- React Native Debugger
- Dash - Mac OSX app for offline documentation 
- XCode & iOS Simulator

## Testing
There are a couple of test cases that were written at the start of the project.

```
$ npm t 
```
